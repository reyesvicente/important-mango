          A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a stationary page)
          is a web page that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as
          stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web
          application.


          Consequently, a static web page displays the same information for all
          users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a web
          server to negotiate content-type or language of the document where
          such versions are available and the server is configured to do so. -
