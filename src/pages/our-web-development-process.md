          The initial contact wherein the client and I have a chat to determine
          their goals for the website.

      - content: >-
          This is the process wherein we would layout the features that we
          understood on the initial contact.

          Next is to create the prototype for the client to see the skeleton of
          the site.

        title: 3.) Prototype Creation
      - content: >-
          After creating the prototype, we would create the draft content for
          the website which is set to be approved by the client.

        title: 4.) Drafting the Content
      - content: >-
          With the prototype and the content ready, this is the time we develop
          the web application. This typically takes 4 - 6 weeks.

        title: 5.) Actual Development
      - content: >-
          Of course, we created something, therefore we have to test what we've
          created. On this stage, we would create tests for the features the
          client requested before we launch it. Typical timeline: 1 - 2 weeks.

      - content: >-
          Once everything sits perfectly, it's time to launch the application to
          the server. This would take more or less 1 week, depending on the
          availability of both parties.

    subtitle: >-
      Over the years, in building web applications, we've learned that at the
      start of our journey, our web development process was scattered. Since
      then, we developed a process in which we made sure that we are more
      productive and are more time saving when developing web applications.
