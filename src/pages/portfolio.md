          As a [Freelance Django/Shopify Developer](https://icvntechstudio.co)
          and [Multimedia Artist](https://www.behance.net/makoythelonebeast), we
          couldn't help but think to add another side-project on our portfolio
          of projects which made us decide to develop this website for everyone.


          This site provides updated real-time data on coronavirus cases from the worldometers page and other important websites, provided by the most reputable organizations and statistical offices in the world. You can check the API [here](https://covid19-docs.chrismichael.now.sh/).


          The site uses [Django](http://djangoproject.org) as the backend technology, [Zurb Foundation](https://get.foundation/) as the frontend technology and web hosting is sponsored by [Digital Ocean](http://bit.ly/highcenbugtv).
