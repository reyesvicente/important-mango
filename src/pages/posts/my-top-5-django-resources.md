I've been using Django for a little less than a year already if I'm not mistaken and I'd like to share the top resources I use when I'm running on a roadblock or if I'm trying to implement something that I haven't implemented yet.

# 1.) [Real Python](https://realpython.com/)

First on the list is Real Python. It is an online learning website that has Python, Django, Kivy and a lot of tutorials that help different kinds of developers with different skill sets. This site was the site I leaned on when I was building my first portfolio in Django. You can check my old site [here](https://highcenburg.herokuapp.com/). 

Aside from learning to build my old portfolio from Real Python, I also learned how to read and [understand the python traceback](https://realpython.com/python-traceback/) which made my life easier when I was developing with Python and when I see someone having troubles with Python, I immediately send them the link and hope they fix the error with the help of the link.

The last and most recent tutorial that I took from this site was [building a mobile app using the Kivy framework](https://realpython.com/mobile-app-kivy-python/). You can go over the [link](https://realpython.com/mobile-app-kivy-python/) to view it or you can clone the mac os app I built on this [repository](https://github.com/reyesvicente/mac-os-calculator).

# 2.) [William Vincent's Site](https://wsvincent.com/)

William is a software developer & a teacher that mainly focuses on Django. He's also part of the non-profit org that runs Django which he's a board member and an individual contributor.

His tutorials were useful when I was developing the site of a non-profit org from India where I had a roadblock in the authentication. Until now, when I need help from a problem, his site is one of the sites I go to for one of my resources to solve the problem at hand.

# 3.) [Vitor Freitas' site aka simpleisbetterthancomplex](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com)

Vitor is a software developer from Brazil and is currently taking up his Ph.D. in Finland. ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/12aWRwUbRHSAX6/giphy.gif)

The most different resource I found on his site was on using the flatpages in Django. Before I discovered the flatpages, I was this silly developer who hardcoded the models, views, and templates for a static site like the about page, privacy policy and the terms of use.

He also has a [detailed blog](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/11/28/advanced-form-rendering-with-django-crispy-forms.html) on how to render forms using the [django-crispy-forms](https://readthedocs.org/projects/django-crispy-forms/). I just remembered that his tutorial helped me build the contact form of [my old portfolio](https://highcenburg.herokuapp.com/contact/) site. ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3osxY7xVVSgMfAPZ16/giphy.gif)

# 4.) [DEV](https://dev.to/t/django)

For those who don't know, I'm the tag mod for Django. I'm always hoping to see a lot of articles on the tag when I log in so I can learn from the more experienced devs.

Some of my favorite Django articles that I have on my reading list are [The complete django-allauth guide](https://dev.to/gajesh/the-complete-django-allauth-guide-la3), although I use cookiecutter-django already, I still lean on to the article to understand cookiecutter-django's codebase deeper.

One of the most informative articles for me on this site is [Modern Django Project Examples](https://dev.to/omenapps/modern-django-project-examples-58mm). It's a curated list of more than 100 open-source Django sites, some of which are still running and are being maintained by certain people.

# 5.) The [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/)

Last but not least is the main documentation. For a second here I was thinking of if I should include it on this list because I use [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) on my Mac and it's pretty amazing rather than going over the site documentation, but then I realized it's just using an API to get the data to show on the mac app hence deciding to include it.

I remember the first time I was able to pull something off using the documentation. I was so amazed and couldn't believe I fixed something on my own. I even tweeted about it look:

### Conclusion:

These are my 4 personal resources when I'm developing using Django. I am not affiliated with them, nor is working for them. I've had this thought on my head for 3 days now hence I decided to write it before I slept.
